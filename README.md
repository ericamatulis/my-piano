# Follow Along - Piano App

This web application allows users to follow along and play a number of available songs in their chosen instrument.
This project was created using React.

Live demo at https://ericamatulis.github.io/my-piano/

## Features

On this web app, you are able to select from the list of available instruments and songs.

After making your selections and loading them onto the app, the app instructs the user how to play the song by highlighting the next key. The user can simply click on the highlighted key to hear the note and go to the next one. If the user plays the wrong note, nothing will happen until they play the correct one.

The keyboard notes load depending on the song that has been chosen.

The user may also use their keyboard to play the notes.
